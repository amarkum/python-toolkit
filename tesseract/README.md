Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. 
That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images.
Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. 
It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types.
supported Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, includes jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.
If used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.
